<h1 id="introduction-to-petsc4py">Introduction to petsc4py</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>petsc4py is a Pythonic interface to PETSc (pronounced: &quot;pet-see&quot;), the Portable Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computing.</p></li>
<li><p>PETSc is a suite of data structures and routines for the scalable (parallel) solution of scientific applications modeled by partial differential equations. <details> PETSc employs a single program multiple (distributed) data programming paradigm, and MPI for all message-passing communication. PETSc is intended for use in large-scale application projects, and several ongoing computational science projects are built around the PETSc libraries. With strict attention to component interoperability, PETSc facilitates the integration of independently developed application modules, which often most naturally employ different coding styles and data structures. </details></p></li>
<li><p>PETSc and petsc4py have been designed to be as easy as possible to use for beginners while still delivering the performance expected of high performance numerical codes. <details> Moreover, PETSc's careful design allows advanced users to have detailed control over the solution process. PETSc includes an expanding suite of parallel linear and nonlinear equation solvers that are easily used in application codes written in C, C++, and Fortran. PETSc provides many of the mechanisms needed within parallel application codes, such as simple parallel matrix and vector assembly routines that allow the overlap of communication and computation. </details></p></li>

<h2 id="laplaces-and-poissons-equations">Laplace's and Poisson's Equations</h2>
<p><details>The Laplacian operator appears in partial differential equations that describe many of the conservation laws of continuum mechanics, electrodynamics, and many other systems. In its simplest form, Laplace's equation, the operator appears as a homogeneous potential equation: </details></p>
<p><span class="math">\[-\nabla^2u = 0\]</span></p>
<p>Note the usage of the minus in our definition, allowing us to deal with the Laplacian as a positive definite operator.</p>
<p>The inhomogenous potential equation with sources is well known as Poisson's equation:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[-\nabla^2u = f\]</span></p>
<h2 id="discretization-of-poissons-equation">Discretization of Poisson's Equation</h2>
<p>For this exercise, we select the second-order finite difference approximation to the solution, source, and Laplace operator:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\mathtt{x} \approx u, \ \ \ \mathtt{b} \approx f, \ \ \ \mathtt{A} \approx \nabla^2u\]</span></p>
<p>We would now like to solve the following system of linear equations: <span class="math">\[\mathtt{A}\mathtt{x} = \mathtt{b}\]</span></p>
<p><details> We represent <code>x</code> and <code>b</code> as PETSc <code>Vec</code> objects in the code. We represent <code>A</code> as a <code>Mat</code> object. </details></p>
<h2 id="the-petsc-mat-object">The PETSc Mat object</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>The PETSc <code>Mat</code> object is a generic discrete linear operator.</p></li>
<li><p>Layout is compressed row storage (Yale) by default</p></li>
<li><p>(Parallel) rows are distributed across processors</p></li>
<li><p>To every extent possible, <code>Mat</code> abstracts the <em>matrix data layout</em> from the code</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="construction-of-a-python-shell-mat-object">Construction of a Python shell Mat object</h2>
<p><details>For several interesting iterative numerical solvers, we do not need to store <code>A</code> directly, and we would instead like to define functions that mimic several aspects of the operator, such as matrix-vector multiplication. In PETSc, this concept is called a <code>shell</code>, and by the dynamic polymorphism of the <code>Mat</code> object, we can compose a <code>shell Mat</code> at runtime. We'll look more into the details of how <code>A</code> is implemented later, but for now PETSc thinks of it as our linear operator, and so should we!</details></p>

<h2 id="the-petsc-vec-object">The PETSc Vec object</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>The PETSc <code>Vec</code> object is a generic element of a discrete vector space.</p></li>
<li><p>Scalar elements of the vector are distributed across processors in the same manner that <code>Mat</code> rows are</p></li>
<li><p>Supports many common mathematical operations in conjunction with the <code>Mat</code> object</p></li>
<li><p>To every extent possible, <code>Vec</code> abstracts the <em>parallel array layout</em> from the code</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="setting-up-solution-and-source-vecs">Setting up solution and source Vecs</h2>
<p><details>We could create our <code>x</code> and <code>b</code> <code>Vecs</code> independently of <code>A</code>, but since it has already been constructed, we can use its <code>getVecs</code> method to build them for us. <em>In the past, the PETSc developers were a little sloppy with the choice of verbs such as &quot;get, create, set, and replace&quot;, getVecs should probably have been createVecs, and may get renamed to this in a future version.</em></p>
<p>1 is a pretty boring choice of right-hand sides, we'll spice this up a little later.</details></p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">x, b = A.getVecs()
<span class="co"># set the initial guess to 0</span>
x.<span class="dt">set</span>(<span class="fl">0.0</span>)
<span class="co"># set the right-hand side to 1</span>
b.<span class="dt">set</span>(<span class="fl">1.0</span>)</code></pre>
<h2 id="the-petsc-ksp-object">The PETSc KSP object</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>The PETSc <code>KSP</code> object is a generic solution strategy for a system of linear equations</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>KSP</code> object supports serial and parallel, iterative and direct linear solvers</p></li>
<li><p>The name comes from Krylov Subspace, which refers to the collection of vectors spanned by the space: <span class="math">\([b Ab A^2b ... A^nb]\)</span>, and which is the basis for many iterative methods</p></li>
<li><p>To every extent possible,<code>KSP</code> abstracts the <em>solver strategy</em> from the code</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="setting-up-the-krylov-solver-ksp">Setting up the Krylov solver (KSP)</h2>
<p><details> Our next step is to choose a solution scheme for solving the system of linear equations. If we don't set a type by default, PETSc will utilize the GMRES method, but since we know our system is symmetric, we select the Conjugate Gradients algorithm, <code>cg</code>, for better performance. </details></p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">ksp = PETSc.KSP().create()
ksp.setType(<span class="st">&#39;cg&#39;</span>)</code></pre>
<p><details>Since we have a <code>shell Mat</code>, most of the interesting preconditioners that rely on access to the <code>Mat</code> data structure won't work, so we turn preconditioning off.</details></p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">pc = ksp.getPC()
pc.setType(<span class="st">&#39;none&#39;</span>)</code></pre>
<p><details> Finally, we inform the <code>KSP</code> object of the operator we are solving for (we could set an additional preconditioning operator here if we liked), then use the <code>setFromOptions</code> function, which allows us to override the options set here from the command-line. </details></p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">ksp.setOperators(A)
ksp.setFromOptions()
ksp.solve(b, x)</code></pre>
<h2 id="some-notes-on-the-syntactic-sugar-in-petsc4py-and-matplotlib">Some notes on the syntactic sugar in petsc4py and matplotlib</h2>
<p>The <code>poisson3d.py</code> demo contains two examples of syntactic sugar that should be noted:</p>
<p><details>First, the function call to <code>numpy.mgrid</code> contains complex step lengths. This is a somewhat dirty (but useful) overload for the <code>mgrid</code> function, allowing the user to request <span class="math">\(n\)</span> equally spaced points inclusively containing 0 and 1.</details></p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">        X, Y =  mgrid[<span class="dv">0</span>:<span class="dv">1</span>:1j*n,<span class="dv">0</span>:<span class="dv">1</span>:1j*n]</code></pre>
<p><details>In a similar vein, the ellipses object in the slice passed to the <code>Vec</code> object, <code>[...]</code>, is syntactic sugar for <code>getArray()</code>, which returns a <code>numpy</code> array representing the data owned by the local process.</details></p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">        Z = x[...].reshape(n,n,n)[:,:,n/<span class="dv">2-2</span>]</code></pre>
<h2 id="exercise-and-demonstration">Exercise and Demonstration</h2>
<p><details> Notes from the demo: * Launch serial jobs with <code>python script.py</code> * Launch parallel jobs with <code>mpirun -n 4 python script.py</code> * Use the <code>-h</code> flag after <code>script.py</code> to get help on specific PETSc options </details></p>
<h2 id="dm---distributed-meshes">DM - distributed meshes</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>The PETSc <code>DM</code> object is a generic geometric discretization of a physical space <details> More specifically, the <code>DM</code> object maps the entries in a <code>Vec</code> object to their geometric locations in 1, 2, and 3 dimensional space and coordinates the parallel distribution of this data<br /></details></p></li>
<li><p>When a stencil extent has been set, the <code>DM</code> object can build and maintain <code>local</code> and <code>global</code> vectors</p>
<ul>
<li><code>global</code> vectors perfectly decompose the spatial discretization</li>
<li><code>local</code> vectors contain &quot;ghost&quot; values, read-only values needed by each processor to compute on its local data</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The <code>DMDA</code> object, which implements <code>DM</code> for simple Cartesian discretizations, provides more intuition on how <code>DM</code> works</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dmda---structured-distributed-meshes">DMDA - structured distributed meshes</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>The PETSc <code>DMDA</code> object is a generic geometric discretization of a structured Cartesian physical space <details> In the context of PETSc, a structured space has a fixed number of grid points in each direction, with either absorbing, reflective, or periodic boundary conditions. This corresponds well to structured finite difference approximations as well as simple quadrilateral and tetrahedral finite element meshes. </details></p></li>
<li><p>The <code>DMDA</code> object can represent structured grids in 1, 2, or 3 dimensions, and also provides convenient array pointers for computing on the boundaries and interior</p></li>
<li><p>To every extent possible, the <code>DMDA</code> abstracts the <em>parallel data layout</em> from the code</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="snes---newton-like-methods-for-nonlinear-systems">SNES - Newton-like methods for nonlinear systems</h2>
<ul>
<li>The PETSc <code>SNES</code> object is a generic solution strategy for a nonlinear system of equations of the form:</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math">\[ F(x) = 0 \]</span> <details></p>
<p>The <code>SNES</code> object is usually built on top of a Newton or quasi-Newton iteration, with search directions updated by solving the Jacobian using a <code>KSP</code> at each step </details></p>
<ul>
<li><p>In the simplest case, the user provides a structured domain and a routine for computing <span class="math">\(F(x)\)</span>, and PETSc does the rest by approximating the Jacobian: <code>-snes_fd</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>SNES</code> also supports matrix-free strategies: <code>-snes_mf</code></p></li>
<li><p>To every extent possible, <code>SNES</code> abstracts the <em>nonlinear solver strategy</em> from the code</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ts---time-integrators">TS - time integrators</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>The PETSc <code>TS</code> object is a generic solution strategy for ordinary differential equations and differential algebraic equations</p></li>
<li><p>Provides Forward Euler, Backward Euler, and a variety of Runge-Kutta and Strong Stability Preserving time integrators</p></li>
<li><p>Can be used to solve equations in steady-state via pseudo-timestepping</p></li>
<li><p>To every extent possible, <code>TS</code> abstracts the <em>time-stepping strategy</em> from the code</p></li>
